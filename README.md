# snake2

This is the version of Snake I developed from scratch with no tutorials at the end of 2021. I am currently revisiting it to try and optimise the code and iron out some of the bugs that I couldn't fix at the end of the last cycle of development.
So far this project has been a success. Not only is the game more stable, but the JS is more concise and easier to read. I have also updated the CSS significantly so that the page is mobile friendly, and I've implemented touch controls for smaller screen resolutions too.
